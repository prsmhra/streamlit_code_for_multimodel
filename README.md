# MultiModelAgentApp

A lightweight, modular application that orchestrates multiple machine-learning models (or model APIs) as agents to solve tasks, route requests, and combine outputs. This README covers purpose, quickstart, structure, configuration, development, and contribution guidelines.

## Project overview
MultiModelAgentApp coordinates multiple model endpoints or local models as independent agents. Agents can be composed into workflows to handle routing, aggregation, and refinement of model outputs. The app focuses on modularity, observability, and easy integration with different model providers.

## Features
- Agent abstraction layer for pluggable models (local and remote)
- Workflow composition (sequential, parallel, conditional)
- Config-driven routing and orchestration
- Logging and basic metrics
- Extensible adapters for new model providers
- Docker-friendly for reproducible deployments

## Repository layout
Example layout (adjust to your repo):
- README.md — this file
- src/ — application source code
    - agents/ — agent implementations and adapters
    - workflows/ — composition logic and pipelines
    - api/ — HTTP/gRPC endpoints, CLI
    - config/ — default configs and schema
- tests/ — unit and integration tests
- scripts/ — helper scripts (build, deploy, local-run)
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml — container specs
- .env.example — example environment variables

## Requirements
- Language runtime: Python 3.10+ or Node 18+ (use the language your repo uses)
- Docker (optional, recommended for deployment)
- Access credentials for any external model providers used (set via env)

## Quickstart (development)
1. Clone the repo:
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd MultiModelAgentApp

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python example):
     python -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt

     Or for Node:
     npm install

3. Copy and edit env example:
     cp .env.example .env
     # update credentials and configuration in .env

4. Run the app locally:
     # Python example
     python -m src.main
     # Node example
     npm run start

5. Run tests:
     pytest
     # or
     npm test

## Configuration
Configuration is environment-driven. Typical variables:
- MODEL_PROVIDER_API_KEY — API key for external model provider
- MODEL_1_ENDPOINT — URL or socket for model 1
- DEFAULT_MODEL — fallback model identifier
- LOG_LEVEL — debug/info/warn/error

See config/schema.yml or .env.example for full list.

## Usage examples
- Start a workflow that combines an LLM with an image model to caption images and refine results.
- Route user queries to specialized models based on intent detection.

Check src/api for example endpoints and payload formats.

## Testing
- Unit tests: tests/unit
- Integration tests: tests/integration (may require real provider credentials or test doubles)
- Run tests with coverage:
    pytest --cov=src

Use mocks for external providers when running CI.

## Deployment
- Build Docker image:
    docker build -t multimodel-agent-app:latest .
- Run with docker-compose (example included):
    docker-compose up --build

Use environment variables or secrets manager for production credentials.

## Contributing
- Fork, create a feature branch, open a PR with a clear description.
- Follow existing code style and add tests for new behavior.
- Keep changes small and focused; document public API changes.
